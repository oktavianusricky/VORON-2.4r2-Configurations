## Configuration Files and Tuning Guides for VORON 2.4r2

### Hardware Configurations :
- Formbot Kit 300mm3
- 300 x 300 x 250 mm configured build volume (250mm because of limited Z height)
- Stealthburner toolhead (without the LEDs)
- Clockwork 2 extruder (with LDO pancake stepper motor)
- Klicky Probe with Auto Z Calibration Plugin
- Waveshare 4.3 inch touchscreen for KlipperScreen
- Trianglelab Phaetus Rapido HF Hotend with 0.4mm nozzle (built-in nozzle from Rapido)
- SUNLU ABS Black and Orange for the colors

### Slicer of Choice : 
- SuperSlicer 2.4.58.5 and can be found [here](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer/releases)
- Most of the parameters are derived from [Ellis's profile](https://github.com/AndrewEllis93/Ellis-SuperSlicer-Profiles) which are already fantastic, but there are some parameters that I would like to configure personally (e.g brim gap, skirt, cooling)
- Please note that the profile is tuned for my specific printer only, it may or may not compatible with yours.
